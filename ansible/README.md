## Ansible

I rarely utilize Ansible as most of the other IaC tools I use handle the tasks I need, and I try to declaratively define my infrastructure so there's less need for maintenance, however, it the backbone of many Actions workflows as it has such good inventory management and it's ability to SSH into different hosts.

Most of the playbooks are pretty basic, I am trying to get more into roles and eventually would like to have multiple roles per host and have this be way more built out.
